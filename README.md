# LinesOfAction

This project is a game, Lines of Action.

Lines of Action (or LOA) is an abstract strategy board game for two players invented by Claude Soucie. The objective is to connect all of one's pieces into a single group.

Goal
The object of the game is to bring all of one's checkers together into a contiguous body so that they are connected vertically, horizontally or diagonally (8-connectivity).

Movement summary
- Players alternate moves, with Black having the first move.
- Checkers move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- A checker moves exactly as many spaces as there are checkers (both friendly and enemy) on the line in which it is moving. For example, Black may open with c8-c6. Black's checker moves two

Startegy
The game can become quite tactical in open positions where the checkers on both sides are mobile. The strategic depth of the game, however, derives to a large extent from blocking strategies designed to limit the opponent's mobility. It can be advantageous to pin one or more enemy checkers against the side of board by moving in the second row or column.
Having more checkers is usually an advantage, because they can limit the opponent's options as they mass together. On the other hand, material considerations are not all-important, because having fewer checkers also means having fewer to unite.

Firsty, on menu page, you can select the algorithm you wanna use:
- Minmax (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
